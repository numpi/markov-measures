# Computing performability measures by matrix functions

This repository contains the code required to replicate the numerical experiments
contained in the paper "Performability measures are matrix function: how to compute
them efficiently". 

The toolbox funm_quad, required to run these examples, can be retrieved [here](guettel.com/funm_quad/)
