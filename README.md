# Computing performability measures by matrix functions

This repository contains the code required to replicate the numerical experiments
contained in the paper "Performability measures are matrix function: how to compute
them efficiently". 

The toolbox <code>funm_quad</code>, required to run these examples, can be retrieved [here](http://guettel.com/funm_quad/)

The software here is described in the following paper:

> Computing performability measures in Markov chains by means of matrix functions. 
> G. Masetti and L. Robol, 2018, arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.06322.
